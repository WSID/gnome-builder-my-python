# gnome-builder-my-python

A plugin (might be a bunch of plugins) that I "possibly" use for myself, for
non-gnome projects.

This plugin set is not associated with `gnome-builder` nor `python`.

## Note

It might not be updated so often, as I'm not currently using the python at work.
Also I'm lazy. `:->`

## Plugins

Currently only one plugin is available for now.

### python-venv

Expose python venv as Gnome Builder's Runtime.
Once set config's runtime into it, other parts can access to it.

Currently only supports venvs created by `python -m venv ...`.
